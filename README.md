# Ads CTR Optimisation using Upper Confidence Bound

We have 10 ads and we need to select the ad which would yield highest CTR(click through rate), in minimum number of trials.
Upper Confidence bound is a type of Reinforcement learning that works on the principle of rewards and punishment. Rather than performing exploration by simply selecting an arbitrary action, chosen with a probability that remains constant, the UCB algorithm changes its exploration-exploitation balance as it gathers more knowledge of the environment. It moves from being primarily focused on exploration, when actions that have been tried the least are preferred, to instead concentrate on exploitation, selecting the action with the highest estimated reward.
